== Introduction
__Tacitus__ was a Roman historian and senator. In his final work the **Annals** (Approximately written around AD 116) he referred to Christ, his execution by Pontius Pilate and verified that early Christians were living in Rome. He also verifies that **a most mischievous superstition**(The Resurrection) was being preached and taught in Rome and that it had spread there from Judæa.



=== What do Scholars Think of Tacticus as a Historian?

Regarding Tacitus as a reliable Historian **Ronald Mellor** warmly praised Tacitus's work __The Annals__:

****
[quote, Ronald Mellor, Tacitus: 1993: pg. 23]
 "The __Annals__ is Tacitus's crowning achievement and this penetrating expose of imperial politics represents the pinnacle of Roman historical writing."

== Documented Event
In the passage that we are most interested in, __Tacitus__ documents a fire that burned much of the city in AD 64 under the rule of the Roman Emperor **Nero**.  This section of writing is considered to be one of the earliest non-Christian references to the the origins of Christianity, it also verifies the  accounts of Christs execution contained within the canonical gospels. It also confirms the persecution of Christians in 1st-century Rome.

.Historical Value of this Passage
====
Scholars consider Tacitus' reference to the execution of Jesus by Pontius Pilate to be **both authentic**, and of **historical value** as an independent Roman source.

**Paul Eddy** and **Gregory Boyd** state that it is now "__firmly established__" that Tacitus provides a non-Christian confirmation of the **crucifixion of Jesus**.

=== Nero Shifts the Blame to Christians

.Tacitus on Nero's Scapegoat
****
[quote, Tacitus: Annuls: (Highlighting mine.)]
#Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures# on a class hated for their abominations, called #Christians# by the populace. #Christus#, from whom the name had its origin, #suffered the extreme penalty# during the reign of #Tiberius# at the hands of one of our #procurators, Pontius Pilatus#, and #a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judæa, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome#, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, #not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind#.

Compare the above passage with **Luke Chapter 3**. You should notice the accounts match, names, places of the time. Josephus in **Antiquity of the Jews** confirms Lukes account regarding the high priests, and John the Baptist.

[quote, Luke 3: ESV]
^*3*^ In the #fifteenth year# of the #reign of Tiberius Caesar#, #Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea#, and #Herod being tetrarch of Galilee#, and his brother #Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis#, and #Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene#, ^*2*^ during the #high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas#,

=== Nero Tortures Christians

After the above passage Tacitus describes the torture of Christians under Nero for their "crimes" "of "hatred against mankind".

.Tacitus on the Torture of Christians Under Nero
****
[quote, Tacitus: Annuls: (Highlighting mine.)]
Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths. #Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished#, or #were nailed to crosses#, or #were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve as a nightly illumination, when daylight had expired#. Nero offered his gardens for the spectacle, and was exhibiting a show in the circus, while he mingled with the people in the dress of a charioteer or stood aloft on a car. #Hence, even for criminals who deserved extreme and exemplary punishment, there arose a feeling of compassion; for it was not, as it seemed, for the public good, but to glut one man's cruelty, that they were being destroyed#.
