.Tacitus on Nero's Scapegoat
[quote, Tacitus: Annuls: (Highlighting mine.)]
____
#Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures# on a class hated for their abominations, called #Christians# by the populace. #Christus#, from whom the name had its origin, #suffered the extreme penalty# during the reign of #Tiberius# at the hands of one of our #procurators, Pontius Pilatus#, and #a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judæa, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome#, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, #not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind#.

.Tacitus on the Torture of Christians Under Nero
[quote, Tacitus: Annuls: (Highlighting mine.)]
____
Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths. #Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished#, or #were nailed to crosses#, or #were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve as a nightly illumination, when daylight had expired#. Nero offered his gardens for the spectacle, and was exhibiting a show in the circus, while he mingled with the people in the dress of a charioteer or stood aloft on a car. #Hence, even for criminals who deserved extreme and exemplary punishment, there arose a feeling of compassion; for it was not, as it seemed, for the public good, but to glut one man's cruelty, that they were being destroyed#.
