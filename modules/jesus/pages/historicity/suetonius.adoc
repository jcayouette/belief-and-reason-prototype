== Documented Events


[quote, Suetonius: Lives of the Caesars: Page 184]
____
The Jews he expelled from Rome, since they were constantly in rebellion, at the instigation of Chrestus.
____

In this first quote some critics claim that we cannot know for sure that it refers to Christ. I disagree for several logical reasons. Why else would the Jews be in rebellion?
If not for the very ideas they had recently crucified Christ for?


[quote, Suetonius: Lives of the Caesars: Page 203]
____
Punishments were imposed on the Christians—adherents of a new
and dangerous superstition
____

Punishments were placed on Christian for their new ideas.
The Christians were certainly preaching Christ and obeying His command to go into the entire world to save the lost.
The traditional Jews in Rome likely rebelled against such teaching which created an uproar.
The Romans naturally did not want to deal with this sort of behavior.
The Roman solution to keep the peace?
Expel the Jews from Rome(Who were obviously not keeping the peace), and punish the "instigators" Christians in this case.

[NOTE]
====
We can probably read further into Roman judgement in this case.
The Jews had created the public issue of not keeping the peace.
The Christians believed in a dangerous superstition because the Ceasars were considered divine.
Christ had come to earth as God in the flesh.
The Christian ideas of the resurrection flew in the face of the Roman Gods and Godesses.
