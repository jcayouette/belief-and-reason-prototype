...the new thing about them is their tone and their emphasis. The New Atheists are much louder and shriller than their predecessors. They are also more aggressive. This change in tone centres on the fact that they are no longer content to simply to deny God's existence. For instance, **Christopher Hitchens** says:

**#"I'm not even an atheist so much as I am an antitheist; I not only maintain that all religions are versions of the same untruth, but I hold that the influence of churches, and the effect of religious belief is positively harmful."#**

The agenda of the New Atheists has widened, therefore, to include attack on the existence of belief itself. This particular feature is described by them as their way of expressing their "loss of respect" for religion. As **Richard Dawkins** puts it:

**#"I am utterly fed up with the respect we have been brainwashed into bestowing upon religion."#**

Christopher Hitchens sums up the position in his all-encompassing, and characteristically wild, statement:

**#"Religion poisons everything."#**

**Bradly Hagerty** on National Public Radio reports Hitchens as saying (to roars of approval from a capacity audience at the University of Toronto):

**#"I think religion should be treated with ridicule, hatred, and contempt, and I claim that right."#**

**Sam Harris's** intention is:

**#"to destroy the intellectual and moral pretensions of Christianity in its most committed forms".#**
